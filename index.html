              To recap: the concept of this performance is a form of prayer through live experimental music (hence
              the name). It reflects on the complex
              relationship we have with
              the heritage we receive, how it affects us and how we affect it, especially in cases where it takes form
              of something we are conflicted about, like carrying a meaningful heritage but it having a strong
              connection with something feel negative about. Wanting to keep it or being unable to escape it, but it
              being inherently
              destructive for us, mentally or otherwise. <br>We
              take it on unknowingly and just as inadvertently we warp it and feed it back into itself, changing its
              meanings or forms.
              Such heritage exists in a sort of flux state, always
              pushing, pulling, changing and interacting with us. It is dynamic yet ever ever-present and
              hard to change, it is always fluid but at times seemingly set in stone. It is shapeless and undefinable in
              expression at times. <br>The performance expresses these complex interactions by both imitating both a
              prayer
              (religious upbringing can leave conflicting feelings, such as unshakeable, irrational guilt or shame for
              being oneself, yet staying rooted deeply in the persons belief system) and hard work on ones knees (hard
              physical labor and poverty often leaves trauma that imprints itself in the heritage).

              This image is a sketch that represents the planned performance. <br>
              It would mean getting down on my knees in front of a central prayer object (intended as an altar, but in
              case that is not possible, something else can be built) and performing music written for the performance.
              I
              would have to move side to side slightly (while remaining on my knees) to control the sound devices, the
              vision is to keep them slightly scatterd. During the entire performance I would be facing
              the "altar" object.

              The scale is slightly off, but represented better here than in the 1st image. There would be multiple
              instruments, connected by cables, and of course power cables. This is a part of the visual idea for it,
              the cables shouldnt be hidden.

          <h3>
            This is a copy of text I already submitted but just for reference I include it again:
          </h3>
          <p>The goal of this performance is to reflect on the complex relationship between, from one side, us as
            individuals with goals, values and world views born from our current understanding of the world and our way
            of life, and, from the other side, the heritage we receive and live through, and later pass down to future
            generations. In this case heritage is the very lived experience in actions and beliefs that becomes a part
            of us. Such heritage can live on through us directly, or show itself differently in execution but with the
            same meanings, or conversely - different meanings but similar actions. <br>
            This relationship exists in many forms, from newer generations finding themselves less religious or
            superstitious than previous ones, therefore having this interaction with religious rituals and values, to
            abuse victims harboring parts passed down to them from their abusers, or even our own past actions changing
            something within our behavior and continuing to live within us. The way that such heritage can live on even
            after purposefully separating yourself from its source is especially of interest to me in the creation of
            this piece. For example, such a situation is rather common in the queer community with some families being
            unable to accept their queer children, and the complex heritage a person would still carry from such a past
            experience and family, but this isn’t exclusive to queer people - complex relationships and heritage often
            form in many toxic families. This can be something light-hearted, like following traditions or rituals out
            of habit or comfort, or complex, like aspects of our personality we cherish or, conversely, deeply despise.
            The way this would be performed (on my knees, in work clothes) also symbolizes the way hard physical labor
            of the previous generations (and the experiences associated with such work) can live on through us. My
            father has worked in construction for a large part of his life so me wearing work pants and performing this
            is, in a way, a tribute to him and his heritage (dreams, trauma) living through me. These lived experiences
            of inheritance is what I’d attempt to explore in this performance.<br>
            These things are rarely gained by decision. Even though this heritage as such is essentially something
            inanimate, we don’t control it. We receive this heritage from others without their intention, and just as
            inadvertently we interact with it and pass it down. Heritage therefore exists similarly to an ever-present
            quantum field. It is seemingly set in stone the way it persists in itself, yet always moving and
            interacting. This is what the sonic aspects of the performance would be based on.
            In a purely practical sense this would be a form of a prayer consisting of experimental electronic music by
            using live musical instruments (synthesizers, drum machines) laid out in front of the altar, performed by me
            on my knees to imitate a form of prayer.<br>
            The performance closely fits the idea of heritage not being a static monument. The very ideas the
            performance touches are hard to define and pick apart, it is, to quote the description of the festival’s
            theme, “a continual process of remembering, rejecting, and re-imagining”. The performance reflects on the
            aspect of relating to trauma of previous generations living through us as something we never experienced
            directly, yet some parts of it still linger in not only our cognition, but in our very spirits. The
            performance lives through those aspects and, in a way, as pressures applied unintentionally by the past.
            This overall understanding of heritage reminds me much of the Higgs mechanism in quantum physics, the
            ever-present process giving everything mass. The Higgs field, mathematically, exists everywhere and we
            merely interact with it (this is of course a gross oversimplification, I am not a physician.) Heritage is
            much like that. We push and pull on it, and it pushes and pulls back on us. This very understanding of
            heritage (and expressions of it) mirror those expressed in the description of the festival: relating to
            “trauma and silences of those who came before”, the conflict between our beliefs, behavior and heritage, and
            the complex question of redefining it. This would also interact well with the central venue of the festival
            being a church and how religion can influence and become part of many aspects of this heritage.<br>
            At the start of the performance, the gear is already set up in front of the altar.
            I enter dressed in construction worker clothes (or similar work clothes), get on my knees facing the altar,
            do the sign of the cross with my hands, I then begin the performance controlling the synthesizers (and
            effects) by hand and play (and synthesize) sounds live. I remain on my knees for the entire performance.
            When I finish the performance, I sign the cross again.<br>
            The performance mirrors both the christian prayer and hard physical labor laying floors.<br>

              track was written as a commission for Samuels
              Ozoliņš' installation "When your body suddenly glitches right before falling asleep, isn't that the snake
              inside of your belly?" The installation (and thusly, the soundtrack) was inspired both by the snake theme
              in many mythologies as a wise yet evil animal and reflected on guilt induced by being a queer person
              coming from christian upbringing. (This short description is of course a gross oversimplification.)
              Church theme is persistent in the track with the warped sound of church bells coming in and out at various
              points. It also loops perfectly, keeping the atmosphere uninterrupted while pushing and pulling on the
              viewer with raising and falling intensity and a touch of recurring dissonance. The track combines many
              layers of
              both the bells (recorded and warped digitally) and many layers of analog synthesis to create a heavy
              dosage of volume - dissonant, all encompassing, powerful, like the feelings of guilt central to this work.
              I named the track "Odze", obviously after the snake.

              This piece was written for an open compilation to raise money for Southern California wildfire victims in
              2025. It
              is a single track recorded in one go (albeit after a couple attempts to get it right) with minimal
              production. A very faint sound was layered in from a different take, I liked it and didn't want to leave
              it out. Multiple different sources feed through eachother (with some no-input mixing techniques and
              sequencing to create controlled feedback) and a delicate balance is achieved to create the tone. To me, it
              is heavy and viscous much like tar. The sound design draws from the idea of heavy, destructive fire and
              smoke. A strong
              inspiration was the heavy over-industrialization of our planet, wrecking it's ecosystems and balance of
              weather, that has caused excessive droughts causing wildfires not only in Cali.

            What I do:
          </h3>
          <p>I have been making music in various forms since late 2013. I now work in mostly what I would consider to be
            experimental music. My single main criteria for my creative output is: make meaningful, thoughtful and fresh
            art. My
            current output
            utilizes sounds mostly generated by hardware - both digital and analog synthesizers and effects. I utilize
            unorthodox techniques, such as sequencing feedback. I am trying to find my ground in the more contemporary
            art related segments of sound, as I feel the most comfortable with those notions of what art generally is. I
            come from a guitar background, so being able to
            perform my music live without pre-recorded sounds is important to me when possible. My output is inspired
            by both complex sounds and rhythms and more rhythmic and drone-y works like, well, drone, but also lowercase
            ambient and dub techno, with some notes of noise. <br> <br>Thank you for reading!
